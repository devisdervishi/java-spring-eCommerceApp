# java-spring-eCommerceApp
My fully backend complete webapp


In the process of creating my application, I wanted to take the opportunity to showcase my knowledge and skills
in Java programming language  and the Spring framework. Coding is not just about achieving a functional outcome,
it's also a means of expressing one's understanding of the language and technology stack.

Throughout the development journey, it's important to understand that the codebase may reflect various aspects of
my coding knowledge and journey and as such, some parts of the code might not necessarily represent the most efficient
way to accomplish a specific task but a representation of another solution that portrays my knowledge.

In building this app, I've tried to cover different aspects of programming like setting up the database structure(dbSchema.png)
to organize data properly, creating repositories to save and fetch data from the database and the controllers used to call and
display this data. To make sure everything works as it should, I also did the testing of these components and made sure to secure
them using the latest technologies for security (spring security 6.x).
This approach shows that I'm learning about various parts of software development, from organizing data to making sure the app
works smoothly.

Note that this project is focused only in developing the backend part of the application and that the frontend and other features
will be added in the future.
